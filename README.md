# GymRat Workout Tracker
GymRat is both a social network for bodybuilders and a workout tracker application. A user can view and add their workouts on their "My Account" page. Workouts are also added to the GymRats community page, where users can view and comment on others' workouts.


## Getting Started

Start by registering your account. To view an example user's pages and workouts, use the login information below.

```
username: mattsm27
password: example
```

A user can view and add their workouts on their "My Account" page. You can view the details for a certain workout by clicking on the workout link. This will take you to a new page where you can view all the stats from that workout, update the workout or delete it. Anytime you add a workout, the workout is also added to the GymRats community page.

The GymRats community page is a forum where you can view and comment on other GymRats' workouts. The link for the page is in your workout board on "My Account". Just like your own workout page, to view another users' workout details, simply click on the workout link. This time, the page displayed will look different than your own because you cannot edit or delete workouts from the GymRat community page. You can add comments for a specific workout on the GymRat workout details page. These comments will also be displayed on your own workout details page in "My Account".

 When a player clicks on the cards selected deck, a modal will open with an image of all the cards that have been selected in the past rounds.

## Planning and Wireframes
Before writing out any code, I like to plan it all on pen and paper, to make sense of things. I did a lot of planning and wireframing on my notebook throughout the whole process of creating this app. These are some images of my notes.

## Updates and Future Goals
It is my hope that with more time and more knowledge, I will be able to add more features to this app. Some of the many things I'd like to add are a search bar - where users can search workout names or user names to find certain workouts â€” and the ability for users to delete their account. Currently, the Add PR button in the user's workout page doesn't do anything. I would also like to add the ability for users to friend each other, and get notifications when people comment on their workouts, when their friends add a workout, etc.
